# Services Section Best Practices for Construction Industry

## Key Principles

### 1. Clear Service Categorization
- Group related services logically
- Primary services prominently featured
- Secondary/specialty services clearly accessible
- Consider service hierarchy for complex offerings

### 2. Benefit-Focused Descriptions
- Lead with client benefit, not technical process
- Answer "what's in it for the client?"
- Use industry-appropriate language (technical but accessible)
- Include specific outcomes where possible

### 3. Visual Representation
- High-quality photos of work in progress or completed
- Before/after comparisons where applicable
- Equipment/team photos build credibility
- Avoid generic stock construction imagery

### 4. Clear Call-to-Action
- Each service should have a CTA
- "Get Quote" or "Request Estimate" works well for B2B
- Phone number for urgent inquiries
- Consider service-specific inquiry forms

## B2B Construction Services Format

### Service Card Structure
```
[SERVICE NAME]
[Tagline: 5-10 word benefit statement]

[Description: 2-3 sentences focusing on client benefit]

Features:
• Feature/capability 1
• Feature/capability 2
• Feature/capability 3
• Feature/capability 4

[CTA Button: Get Quote]
```

## What Works

### Effective Service Descriptions
- Specific to the service (not generic)
- Mention materials/methods used
- Include service area if relevant
- Reference certifications/standards

### Trust Builders Within Services
- "Certified in [standard]"
- "Used on [notable project]"
- "Trusted by [major client]"
- Equipment/technology highlights

### Service Page SEO
- One primary keyword per service
- Location qualifiers in titles
- Schema markup for services
- Internal linking between related services

## What to Avoid

1. **Generic descriptions** - "We offer quality construction services"
2. **Too much jargon** - Balance technical accuracy with accessibility
3. **Missing CTAs** - Every service needs clear next step
4. **Stock photography** - Use real project images
5. **Price focus** - B2B rarely shows prices; focus on value
6. **Overwhelming options** - Group services logically

## Service Page vs Service Section

### When to Use Service Cards (Section)
- 5-9 services total
- Services are relatively similar in scope
- Quick overview is sufficient
- Single-page websites

### When to Use Individual Service Pages
- 4+ major services with distinct audiences
- Services need detailed explanation
- SEO targeting for specific services
- Complex service offerings

## Construction-Specific Considerations

### B2B Service Presentation
- Technical capabilities matter
- Equipment list adds credibility
- Safety certifications expected
- Project examples essential

### Service Categories (Precast/Rigging)
**Installation Services**
- Panel erection
- Crane coordination
- Lift planning

**Finishing Services**
- Joint sealing
- Grouting
- Skincoating

**Repair Services**
- Concrete repairs
- Crack injection
- Surface treatment

**Support Services**
- Props management
- General labour
- Site preparation

## Template Structure
