# Services Section Best Practices (General)

## Purpose

The Services section must:
1. **Clearly list** what services are offered
2. **Explain benefits** - what the customer gets
3. **Build confidence** - why choose this provider
4. **Guide action** - lead to contact/quote

## Key Principles

### Service Listing

- Group related services logically
- Lead with most popular/profitable services
- Use customer language, not industry jargon
- Each service needs clear description

### Service Descriptions

For each service include:
- **What it is** (1-2 sentences)
- **Who it's for** (target customer)
- **What's included** (deliverables)
- **Why choose us** (differentiator)
- **Next step** (CTA)

### Pricing Approach

- "Starting from $X" when possible
- "Free Quote" if pricing varies
- Avoid hiding pricing completely
- Be transparent about what affects price

## What Works

### Content Elements

- Service name (clear, searchable)
- Brief description (2-3 sentences)
- Key benefits (bullet points)
- What's included (checklist)
- Relevant photo/icon
- Individual service CTA

### Layout Options

- Grid of service cards
- Accordion for many services
- Tabs for service categories
- Dedicated page per service (for SEO)

## What to Avoid

- Vague service names ("Solutions")
- Walls of text
- Missing CTAs
- No way to learn more
- Technical jargon
- Hiding services behind "And more..."
