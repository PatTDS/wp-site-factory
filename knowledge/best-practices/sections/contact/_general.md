# Contact Section Best Practices (General)

## Purpose

The Contact section converts interest into action by:
1. **Making it easy** to reach the business
2. **Offering options** - phone, form, email, location
3. **Setting expectations** - response time, hours
4. **Building confidence** - they'll respond and help

## Key Principles

### Contact Information Hierarchy

For most local businesses, order by preference:
1. **Phone number** - Prominent, clickable on mobile
2. **Contact form** - For non-urgent/after-hours
3. **Email** - Direct contact option
4. **Physical address** - For location-based trust
5. **Social media** - Secondary channels

### Form Design

- **Minimal fields** - Name, Phone, Email, Message (4 fields ideal)
- **Clear labels** - What to enter
- **Mobile-friendly** - Easy to tap and type
- **Confirmation** - Clear success message
- **Response time** - Set expectations ("We respond within 24 hours")

### Hours and Availability

- Display business hours clearly
- Note emergency/after-hours availability
- Timezone if serving wide area
- Holiday closures

## What Works

### Content Elements

- Phone number (large, prominent)
- Click-to-call on mobile
- Simple contact form
- Business hours
- Physical address with map
- Response time promise
- Alternative contact methods

### Layout Options

- Two columns: Info + Form
- Full-width form with info below
- Sticky contact bar (phone/form)
- Chat widget integration

### Trust Enhancers

- Security badges (if accepting sensitive info)
- Google Map embed

## What to Avoid

- Generic "Submit" button
- No confirmation after form submit
- Outdated hours
