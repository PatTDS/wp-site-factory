- "Free quotes with no obligation"
- Named team members

- Clear service area

### Form Success Messages
```
Good: "Thanks for your enquiry! Our team will be in
touch within 24 hours to discuss your project."

Better: "Thanks [Name]! [Contact Name] from our team
will call you within 24 hours to discuss your
[Service] requirements for [Company]."
```

## What to Avoid

1. **Generic contact info** - "Contact us" with no details
2. **Too many form fields** - Keep under 10 fields
3. **Hidden phone numbers** - Make them prominent
4. **No response expectation** - State when you'll respond
5. **Broken forms** - Test regularly
6. **No mobile optimization** - Click-to-call essential

## Construction-Specific Considerations

### B2B Contact Expectations
- Direct access to decision makers
- Quick response times
- Technical competence in responses
- Project-specific follow-up
- Professional communication

### Emergency/Urgent Contacts
```
For urgent project needs:
[Name] - [Phone]
Available: Mon-Fri 6AM-8PM
Weekend by arrangement
```

### After-Hours Consideration
- Construction operates early (6AM starts common)
- Extended hours appreciated
- Emergency contact for ongoing projects
- Clear out-of-hours expectations
