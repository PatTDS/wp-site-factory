# About Us Section Best Practices (General)

## Purpose

The About Us section builds trust and emotional connection by:
1. **Humanizing** the business (real people, real story)
2. **Establishing credibility** (experience, qualifications)
3. **Creating connection** (shared values, local ties)

## Key Principles

### Story Structure

- **Origin story** - Why the business was started
- **Mission** - What drives the team
- **Values** - What the business stands for
- **Differentiator** - What makes them unique

### Trust Signals

- Years in business
- Number of customers served
- Professional certifications
- Industry memberships
- Awards and recognition
- Local community involvement

### Human Element

- Founder/owner story and photo
- Team photos (real, not stock)
- Personal connection to the work
- Why they care about quality

## What Works

### Content Elements

- First-person narrative ("We started because...")
- Specific numbers ("Since 2005", "Over 2,000 projects")
- Local ties ("family-owned Sydney business")
- Customer-focused mission
- Team introductions with photos

### Layout

- Photo of founder/team prominently displayed
- Key stats in visual format
- Timeline for established businesses
- Video introduction (optional but effective)

## What to Avoid

- Corporate jargon ("synergy", "leverage")
- Generic mission statements
- Wall of text without visual breaks
- No photos or only stock photos
- Third-person voice ("The company was founded...")
- Irrelevant information
