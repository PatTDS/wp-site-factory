# Hero Section Best Practices for Construction Industry

## Key Principles

### 1. Immediate Value Proposition
- Lead with what you do and who you serve
- B2B focus: speak to builders, developers, contractors
- Highlight specialization (e.g., "precast services" not just "construction")

### 2. Trust Signals Above the Fold
- Major client logos or partnerships
- Years of experience
- Certifications/credentials
- Service area coverage

### 3. Strong Visual Impact
- High-quality project photography
- Video backgrounds showing work in progress (2024 trend)
- Professional imagery of equipment, team, finished projects
- Avoid generic stock photos

## What Works

### Effective Headlines
- "Expert [Service] Solutions From Start to Finish"
- "Your Trusted [Specialization] Partner"
- "[Location]'s Leading [Service] Provider"
- "Quality [Service] for [Target Audience]"

**Formula**: [Benefit/Expertise] + [Specialization] + [Geographic/Audience Qualifier]

### Subheadline Patterns
- Address the client's project success
- Mention key services (2-3 max)
- Include trust indicator (years, projects, clients)
- Geographic qualifier for local SEO

### CTA Best Practices
- Primary: Action-oriented ("Request a Quote", "Get Started", "Contact Us")
- Secondary: Lower commitment ("View Our Projects", "Learn More")
- Phone number prominently displayed (construction clients often prefer calling)

## What to Avoid

1. **Generic messaging** - "Quality construction services" says nothing
2. **Too much text** - Hero should be scannable in 3 seconds
3. **No clear CTA** - Always have next step visible
4. **Stock photography** - Use real project photos
5. **Missing trust signals** - Construction is high-stakes, credibility matters
6. **No mobile optimization** - 60%+ view on mobile devices

## Construction-Specific Elements

### B2B vs B2C Considerations
- B2B: Focus on partnership, reliability, project support
- B2B: Highlight major client relationships
- B2B: Technical capability messaging
- Less emotional, more professional tone

### Industry Trust Signals
- ISO certifications
- Safety certifications
- Trade association memberships
- Insurance/liability documentation
- Major builder partnerships

## Template Structure

```
[HERO SECTION]
├── Background: Project photo or video
├── Headline: Benefit + Specialization (6-10 words)
├── Subheadline: Expanded value prop (15-25 words)
├── Primary CTA: "Request Quote" / "Get Started"
├── Secondary CTA: "View Projects" / "Our Services"
├── Trust badges: 3-4 client logos or credentials
└── Phone number (prominent)
```

## Examples for Precast/Rigging

**Good**: "Expert Precast Solutions From Start to Finish"
**Better**: "Sydney's Trusted Precast Partner - Panel Installation to Finishing"

**Good**: "Professional rigging services"
**Better**: "Safe, Precise Panel Installation for Australia's Leading Builders"
