# Hero Section Best Practices (General)

## Purpose

The hero section is the first thing visitors see. It must immediately communicate:
1. **What** the business does
2. **Who** it serves
3. **Why** they should care (value proposition)

## Key Principles

### Headlines

- **Be specific** - "Sydney's #1 Emergency Plumber" beats "Quality Plumbing Services"
- **Include benefit** - What does the customer get?
- **Use power words** - Fast, Guaranteed, Free, Expert, Local
- **Keep it short** - 6-10 words ideal
- **Front-load keywords** - Important words first

### Subheadlines

- Expand on the headline
- Address a pain point or desire
- Include a timeframe or guarantee if possible
- 15-25 words typical

### Call-to-Action (CTA)

- **One primary CTA** - Don't overwhelm
- **Action-oriented text** - "Get Free Quote" not "Submit"
- **Create urgency** - "Call Now", "Book Today"
- **Make it visible** - Contrasting color, prominent placement

### Visual Elements

- High-quality hero image or video
- Shows the service/product in action
- Real photos over stock when possible
- Faces build trust (for service businesses)

## What Works

- Location in headline for local businesses
- Numbers and specifics ("15+ Years", "500+ Projects")
- Social proof near CTA ("Trusted by 1000+ homeowners")
- Clear phone number visible

## What to Avoid

- Generic headlines ("Welcome to Our Website")
- Multiple competing CTAs
- Auto-playing video with sound
- Stock photos that look fake
- Too much text in hero area

## Formula Templates

### Service Business
```
[Location]'s [Adjective] [Service] - [Benefit]
Subheadline: [Pain point solution] + [Guarantee/Timeframe]
CTA: [Action] + [Offer]
```

Example:
```
Melbourne's Fastest Emergency Plumber - Available 24/7
Burst pipe? We'll be there in 60 minutes or your callout is free.
CTA: Call Now - Free Quote
```

### Product Business
```
[Product] That [Benefit]
Subheadline: [How it works] + [Social proof]
CTA: [Shop/Order] + [Incentive]
```
